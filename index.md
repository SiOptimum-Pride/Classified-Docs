### What I think of Flowers for Algernon

I will only make my own recap of this story so please, bear with me.

When I started reading the story I was so angry at the wrong spelling of each word until my teacher explained that it as some kind of study regarding humans can still read misspelled words as long as they have the starting and ending letter correct.
I also got angry when the teachers are making us read things with countless errors and that we have wrong answers when we misspell a word or two!
I let my mom read it she said that it's like Uncle Tom's Cabine (I haven't read it yet but I still believe her.)

Doctors Nemur and Strauss were looking for a way to heighten intelligence and experimented on a mouse named Algernon.
Algernon is a white mouse who that was the first successful test subject for an experimental operation that can increase his intelligence.
So, the next character is a human named Charlie. He has a very low IQ and wanted to be smart. They conducted multiple tests on him namely the Rorschach inkblot tests, a Thematic Apperception Test, and "amazed" tests which involves Algernon.
Charlie's teacher, Miss Kinnian recommended him to be the next test subject for the experiment. But, both doctors were arguing about him being the next test subject Dr. Nemur was worried about using Charlie though, Dr. Strauss told him Miss Kinnian recommended him because he was the best from all the people she was teaching. They don't know if the result of the experiment will be permanent bus there's a chance. They also argued about his motivation which Algernon possessed too. 

After Charlie underwent the surgery and became smarter and smarter in each progress report that's when I suspected something... ![I![rzr2flpmfp861](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99947343/156520065-4c1ee3c1-eb75-4e29-96a3-52c0bce46c36.jpg)

Before the operation, the doctors didn't feed Charlie due to unspecified reasons Dr. Strauss said he can eat after the operation.

Now that the operation is done, Charlie continued with his tests and different races with Algernon. Dr. Strauss said Charlie needs to play those games, he has redo the inkblot tests some time, and the pictures (he likes to draw a picture of a man and a woman but he won't make up lies about people.)
Near the end of the story, Algernon bit Charlie and started to show bizarre behavior. He was less cooperative, refuses to run the maze anymore; general motivation has decreased. And he hasn't been eating.
